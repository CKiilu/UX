# USER BASED DESIGN

## INTRODUCTION

Creation of software based on the needs and interests of the user to make projects easy for users to use and comprehend how they work.

Designs should:

1. Make it easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment.

2. Make things visible: a conceptual model of system, alternative actions and results of actions taken.

3. Make it easy to evaluate current state of the system.

4. Follow natural mappings between intentions and required actions that are inferred from visible information.

## MAKING COMPLEX TASKS SIMPLE

### 1. Use knowledge in the world and the head

The design should not impede action but should combine both types of knowledge depending on which type is available.

#### CONCEPTUAL MODELS

There are three aspects of metal models: the design model, the user's model and the system image.

__Note__: 

Design model: The concept the designer thinks of.

User's model: Concept the user develops to understand the workings of the system based on their knowledge from using it.

System image: The inner working of the system. The user develops knowledge of the system from the understanding obtained from here.

#### MANUALS

Ideally manuals should be written first and designs should follow the manuals. However, they are often written after product completion when there and time and resource constraints.

Many of the best manuals are not read by users.

### 2.Simplify task structures

Simplification minimizes the amount of planning and problem solving required for tasks. A designer should pay attention to the limits on a person's memory and attention

Task should be provide aids or be restructured using new technology to achieve this.

Method used to achieve this include:

1. __Keeping the task the same but providing mental aids.__ These remind users of and perform tasks which are tedious to do manually.

2. __Using technology to selectively make visible, invisible aspects of a system.__ In situations where information about a system is needed graphic displays are used to give a complete image. This enables users to concentrate on important things rather than the processes.

3. __Automation without changing the task's nature.__ However, automation has pros and cons depending on the task and thus needs consideration on whether one requires full control over a task. 

4. __Change the task's nature.__ Changing how the task is performed  can simplify it.

#### DANGERS OF AUTOMATION

Over-automation leads to over-reliance on automated equipment. Such a person cannot operate equipment without the system and in case of system failure cannot fix the problem.

### 3. Make things visible

Making things visible on the execution side shows users what is possible and how actions should be performed while visibility on the evaluation side shows effects of their actions.

The system should show how actions match intentions.

### 4.Get mappings right

The user should be able to understand the relationship between:

1. Intentinons and actions

2. Actions and their effects

3. The actual system state and what is perceived by the senses

4. The perceived system state and user needs, intentions and expectations

Natural mappings are the basis of response compatibility in the field of ergonomics.
Response compatibility's major requirement is that positioning of a system's/object's controls should be as direct as possible.

### 5. Exploit power of constraints

Design of the system in a way that suggest to the user that there is only the correct possible option to perform.

### 6. Design for error

Errors occur from incorrect actions made by the user therefore the system must incorporate such user actions into it. It should be made easy to: recover from errors, to find out the error and its effects and to reverse unwanted outcomes. However, it should be made hard to perform irreversible actions.

### 7. Standardize, where all else fails

Creating an international standard requires the mechanism to only be learned once. Users need to be trained to the standards especially if they are changing to a different system for the purpose of standardization.

With standardization of technology, its causality increases.

#### TIMING OF STANDARDIZATION

Early standardization may cause people to be confined to using a primitive system. Late standardization leads to development of multiple ways to perform a task such that no international standard can be agreed on.

## DELIBERATE COMPLICATION OF TASKS

To ensure a system is secure sensitive parts should be left cryptic by:

1. Hiding critical components

2. Using unnatural mappings for the  execution side of the action cycle to make the system's relationship with its controls haphazard

3. Making actions to access it physically difficult

4. Not giving feedback

5. Using unnatural mappings for the evaluation side of the action cycle to make system state difficult to interpret
