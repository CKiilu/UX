# USER BASED DESIGN

## INTRODUCTION

Creation of software based on the needs and interests of the user to make projects easy for users to use and comprehend how they work.

Designs should:

1. Make it easy to determine what actions are possible at any moment.

2. Make things visible: a conceptual model of system, alternative actions and results of actions taken.

3. Make it easy to evaluate curent state of the system.

4. Follow natural mappings between intentions and required actions that are inferred from visible information.

## MAKING COMPLEX TASKS SIMPLE

### 1. Use knowledge in the world and the head

The design should not impede action but should combine both types of knowledge depending on which type is available.

#### CONCEPTUAL MODELS

There are thre aspects of metal models: the design model, the user's model and the system image.

__Note__: 

Design model: The concept the designer thinks of.

User's model: Concept the user develops to understand the workings of the system based on thei knowledge from using it.

System image: The inner working of the system. The user develops knowledge of the system from the understanding obtained from here.

#### MANUALS

Ideally manuals should be written first and designs should follow the manuals. However, they are often written after product completion when there and time and resource constraints.

Many of the best manuals are not read by users.

### 2.Simplify task structures

Simplification minimizes the amount of planning and problem solving required for tasks. A designer should pay attention to the limits on a person's memory and attention

Task should be provide aids or be restructured using new technology to achieve this.

Method used to achieve this include:

1. __Keeping the task the same but providing mental aids.__ These remind users of and perform tasks which are tedious to do manually.

2. __Using technology to selectively make visible, invisible aspects of a system.__ In situations where information about a system is needed graphic displays are used to give a complete image. This enables users to concentrate on important things rather than the processes.

3. __ Automation without changing the task's nature.__ However, automation has pros and cons depending on the task and thus needs consideration on whether one requires full control over a task. 

4. __Change the task's nature.__ Changing how the task is performed  can simplify it.

#### DANGERS OF AUTOMATION

Overautomation leads to overreliance on automated equipment. Such a person cannot operate equipment without the system and in case of system failure cannot fix the probelem.

### 3. Make things visible



### 4.Get mappings right

### 5. Exploit power of constraints

### 6. Design fo error

### 7. Standardize, where all else fails
